# 01-Introduction

This assignment is an introductory assignment for my MSCH-C220 class at IU. We've been instructed to answer a few questions about ourselves and code and print them on the main.py file. I've done this by typing "print('text here')" for each line and putting in one of my answeres in the text here section.

The questions we had to answer was what is my name, what is my facvorite game, concerns about the class, what I'm excited about, what ym stackoverflow.com user number is, and what the URL to my github.com profile. All of that information can be found on the main.py page.

Also, we had to put the year and our full name on the license page to give away our copyright and allow anyone to use the code I have written there.
